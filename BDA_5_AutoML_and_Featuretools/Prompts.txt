“Write Python code using H2O AutoML to train regression models. Include pandas and numpy
for data manipulation. Ignore warnings."

“Create a Python class that automates training and comparison of feature engineering
approaches using H2O AutoML. It should load data from a CSV, let me specify the target
column, and set a time limit.”

“Add a method to load the CSV and show dataset shape, features, and target stats.”

“Create meaningful domain-specific features for the California Housing dataset using latitude,
longitude, median income, average rooms, etc. Include location-based, income, and
interaction terms.”

“Create meaningful domain-specific features for the California Housing dataset using latitude,
longitude, median income, average rooms, etc. Include location-based, income, and
interaction terms.”

“Add another dataset created by FeatureTools, merge it with mine, and use the top 30
correlated features.”

“Add a method to check for data leakage between train and test sets by comparing
overlapping rows and checking for highly correlated features with the target.”

“Write a function to manually calculate RMSE, MAE, R², and MAPE for regression using NumPy
arrays. Also compute % of predictions within 10% and 20% of actual values.”

“Write a function to analyze feature importance from the best model in H2O AutoML, handle
stacked ensembles by finding the base model, and categorize features by origin (original,
manual, FeatureTools).”

“Add a function to check for data leakage between train and test data.”

“Show feature importance for the best model from H2O AutoML.”

“Write a method to evaluate a trained AutoML model on test data, print metrics clearly, and
return a dictionary with results.”

“Write a function that runs AutoML on different feature sets (original, engineered, combined,
auto, featuretools only) and compares their performance.”
